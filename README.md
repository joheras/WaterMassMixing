# Water Mass Mixing

Supplementary materials of the paper "Application of multi regression machine learning algorithms to resolve oceanic water mass mixing"

The description of each of the files is the following:
* README.md: This file.
* AtlanticOceanDatabase_clean.csv: Contains the data of the water samples used in (Romera-Castillo et al., 2019) together with the results of the OMP analysis in that paper.
* Water masses-IndependentLocations.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with all the instructions to run ML models on water samples. Used to train and evaluate different models in order to solve the water mixing problem.
